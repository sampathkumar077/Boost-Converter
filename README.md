# Boost-Converter
A 100W Boost Converter with an input of 12V and output of 24V is designed. They are generally used for industrial purposes such as load matching for variable drives and also for the testing /trouble shooting of small scale electronics.so,in this project we are going to build a simple 12v to 24v dc to dc converter circuit using NE555 precision timer IC.the PWM signal required for the mosfets is provided by the triggering circuit.A NE555 timer IC serves as the core of this circuit. The IC possesses an oscillation frequency ranging 2kHz. Here, this NE555 timer acts as an astable multivibrator An astable multivibrator is a free-running oscillator that switches continuously between its two unstable states. With no external signal applied, the transistors alternately switch from cutoff to saturation state at a frequency that RC time constants of the coupling circuit determine.If these time constants are equal (R and C are equal) then a square wave will generate with a frequency of 1/1.4 RxC. Hence, an astable multivibrator is also a pulse generator or a square wave generator.
